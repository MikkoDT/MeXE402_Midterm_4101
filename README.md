    - Introduction: Overview of Linear and Logistic Regression.
    - Dataset Description: Details about the datasets used.
    - Project Objectives: What you aim to achieve with your analyses.
**2. Linear Regression Analysis**
- Perform Linear Regression using the selected continuous dependent variable.
  - Tasks:
    - Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data if necessary.
    - Model Implementation: Use appropriate libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn in Python).
    - Evaluation Metrics: Calculate R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc.
    - Interpretation: Explain the significance of coefficients and the model's predictive power.
**3. Logistic Regression Analysis**
- Perform Logistic Regression using the selected categorical dependent variable.
  - Tasks:
    - Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, balance classes if needed.
    - Model Implementation: Use appropriate libraries.
    - Evaluation Metrics: Calculate Accuracy
    - Visualization: Plot confusion matrices
    - Interpretation: Discuss the model's ability to classify and the importance of features.
**4. Documentation**
- Code Comments: Ensure all code is well-commented and readable.
- Methodology: Document each step taken during analysis.
- Results: Summarize findings and include tables or charts where appropriate.
- Discussion: Reflect on the results, compare the two regression methods, and mention any limitations.

### Day 3: Finalization and Submission
### Objectives
- Finalize your GitHub repository.
- Submit your completed project.
### Activities
**1. Repository Review**
- Proofread all written content for clarity and grammatical accuracy.
- Verify that all links, images, and references are working.
- Ensure that the repository is well-organized with clear directories for code, data, and documentation.
2. Submission
- Make me a collaborator of the repository.
- Deadline: October 25, 2024, by 11:59 PM.
- Accessibility: Make sure the repository is private for now.

### Day 4: Presentation of the Repository and Findings
