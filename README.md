## Midterm Exam Instructions
## Course: MeXE 402 - Mechatronics Engineering Elective 2: Data Science and Machine Learning
## Exam Format: Pair-Based Project
## Submission Deadline: October 27, 2024

## **Overview**
This midterm exam is designed to assess your understanding of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression through practical application on real-world datasets. You will work in pairs to explore assigned topics, perform analyses, and document your findings.

### Day 1: Topic and Dataset Exploration
#### Objectives
- Understand your assigned topics and datasets.
- Identify appropriate dependent variables for Linear and Logistic Regression.
- Explain your choices and reasoning to the instructor.

**Activities**
1. Dataset Assignment
- Each pair will be provided with links to specific datasets suitable for both Linear and Logistic Regression analyses.
2. Dataset Analysis
- Explore the datasets thoroughly.
- Identify all variables and understand their types (continuous, categorical).
- Determine which variables are suitable as dependent variables for Linear and Logistic Regression.
3. Preparation for Instructor Meeting
a. Dependent Continuous Variable for Linear Regression
- Tell me the continuous variable from your dataset to use as the dependent variable in Linear Regression.
- Prepare an explanation of why this variable is appropriate for Linear Regression.
b. Categories for Logistic Regression
- Tell me the categorical variable from your dataset to use as the dependent variable in Logistic Regression.
- Prepare an explanation of why this variable is suitable for Logistic Regression.
4. Instructor Meeting

Before class dismissal, present the following to the instructor:

Explanation of the Topic: Brief overview of your assigned topics.
Dataset Insights: Key characteristics and variables in your dataset.
Chosen Dependent Variables: Which variables you've selected and why.
Initial Observations: Any patterns or issues noticed in the dataset.
Day 2: Repository Creation and Regression Analysis
Objectives
Set up a GitHub repository to document your project.
Perform Linear and Logistic Regression analyses.
Document your methodology, code, and findings.
Activities
GitHub Repository Setup

Create a new GitHub repository named MeXE402_Midterm_[YourNames].

Include a README.md file that covers:

Introduction: Overview of Linear and Logistic Regression.
Dataset Description: Details about the datasets used.
Project Objectives: What you aim to achieve with your analyses.
Linear Regression Analysis

Perform Linear Regression using the selected continuous dependent variable.

Tasks:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data if necessary.
Model Implementation: Use appropriate libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn in Python).
Evaluation Metrics: Calculate R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc.
Visualization: Create scatter plots, regression lines, and residual plots.
Interpretation: Explain the significance of coefficients and the model's predictive power.
Logistic Regression Analysis

Perform Logistic Regression using the selected categorical dependent variable.

Tasks:

Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, balance classes if needed.
Model Implementation: Use appropriate libraries.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC.
Visualization: Plot confusion matrices, ROC curves.
Interpretation: Discuss the model's ability to classify and the importance of features.
Documentation

Code Comments: Ensure all code is well-commented and readable.
Methodology: Document each step taken during analysis.
Results: Summarize findings and include tables or charts where appropriate.
Discussion: Reflect on the results, compare the two regression methods, and mention any limitations.
Day 3: Finalization and Submission
Objectives
Finalize your GitHub repository.
Submit your completed project.
Activities
Repository Review

Proofread all written content for clarity and grammatical accuracy.
Verify that all links, images, and references are working.
Ensure that the repository is well-organized with clear directories for code, data, and documentation.
Submission

Submit the link to your GitHub repository via the designated submission platform or email.
Deadline: October 27, 2024, by 11:59 PM.
Accessibility: Make sure the repository is public or share access with the instructor.
